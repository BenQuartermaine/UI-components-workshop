# UI-components-workshop

Before we get started
1. Make sure you have a text editor (Sublime or VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) are both great ones)
2. Open your terminal and clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/BenQuartermaine/UI-components-workshop`
3. You may need to install git in your terminal. 
   Follow the instructions here:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
   
Todays workshop is focused on building components that we can reuse throughout our designs, to make them consistent and reusable. Its mostly a mindset. 

The components we will focus on today are buttons, cards, banners and avatars. 

If you get stuck, remember to google. Here are a few resources that might be helpful:
1. Le Wagon's UI Kit: https://uikit.lewagon.com/documentation
2. HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
3. CSS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
4. Flexbox Game (very fun): https://flexboxfroggy.com/
5. Flexbox documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox


You'll complete exercises 1-4 in your `components.html` sheet.
Exercise 1
- Create an avatar 
For this you'll need an image and to use the `border-radius` property in CSS

Exercise 2
- Create a button
Buttons typically lead you to another page or help perform an action on your current page. To create one you'll need either an <a> tag or a <button> tag, and then to style it with CSS (perhaps the `color`, `background-color` and `border-radius` properties will come in handy for this. 

Exercise 3
- Create a card
For arranging different elements in a card you'll need to position them. There is many ways to do this. A good place to start is with flexbox â€” 95% of components on the web will use flexbox in some form, so its worth understanding.

Exercise 4
- Create a banner
Now position some text and a button (and anything else you'd like) on top of an image. For this exercise you'll need to use the CSS property of `background-image`.

Exercise 5
- Combine into a beautiful page

Now bring it all together by combining your components into a page. 
Move into your `index.html` and start to arrange your components on the page.
Don't forget to give your elements some `margin` and `padding` so they have space to breathe
